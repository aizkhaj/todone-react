## Summary

This is a front end application built in React.js for Todone API (which is an API built in Node.js for an overengineered to do application). There is no state management library like Redux or Flux, etc. It's pure React. Bootstrap was also used to help...bootstrap the design.

## Features

- Create multiple lists that can fold away and seen on one page.

- Create tasks for each list, mark them complete.

- Data persists thanks to API requests and use of states.
